<h1>ENGLISH</h1>
<P><b>English</b> c, <br> called Anglophones, originated in early medieval England on the island of Great Britain. The namesake of the language is the Angles, one of the ancient Germanic <br>peoples that migrated to Britain. It is the most spoken language in the world, primarily due to the global influences of the former British Empire (succeeded by the Commonwealth of Nations) and the United States.</P>

<h1>BIOLOGY</h1>
<p><b>Biology</b> is the scientific study of life.It is a natural science with a broad scope but has <br>several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field.For instance, all organisms are made up of at least one cell that processes hereditary <br>information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future generations. Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life. Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce.</p>
